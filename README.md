This is my first Capstone Project from [The Complete Web Development Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/).  
The project is built using **only HTML**, without any CSS or JavaScript, as required.

## 📄 Project Overview

This is a multi-page online resume, built with plain HTML, to practice semantic tags and structure:

- **Home (index.html)**: Contains summary, education, work experience, skills, and achievements.
- **Hobbies (hobbies.html)**: Personal interests and activities.
- **Contact (contact.html)**: Email and phone details (fictional).

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- HTML5 – Page structure and semantic content
- Git & GitHub – Version control and collaboration
- GitHub Pages – Hosting the resume online
